CONTENTS:

The package contains four exercises:

exercise1.m -- Part I: Sparse features for matching specific objects in images
exercise2.m -- Part II: Affine co-variant detectors
exercise3.m -- Part III: Towards large scale retrieval
exercise4.m -- Part IV: Large scale retrieval

The computer vision algorithms are implemented by VLFeat
(http://www.vlfeat.org). This package contains the following MATLAB
functions:

findNeighbours.m
        Match features based on their descriptors.

geometricVerification.m
        Geometrically verify feature matches.

getFeatures.m
        Extract features from an image.

getHistogramFromImage.m
        Get a feature hisotgram from an image.

getHistogram.m
        Get a feature histogram from quantised features.

loadIndex.m
        Load an image datbase with an inverted index.

plotbox.m
        Plot boxes.

plotMatches.m
        Plot feature matches.

plotRetrievedImages.m
        Plot search results.

plotQueryImage.m
        Plot the query image for a set of search results.

search.m
        Search an image database.

setup.m
        Setup MALTAB to use our software.


APPENDX (INSTALLATION):

Run MATLAB and execute the command PREPROCESS() in extra/. This will
download the VLFeat library (http://www.vlfeat.org), then, it will
compute a visual vocabulary and features for standard datasets.
